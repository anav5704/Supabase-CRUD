# Supa Smoothies ðŸ¥¤

![hero](https://github.com/anav5704/Supabase-CRUD/blob/main/docs/supa-smoothies.png)

This is a simple website where you can perform CRUD operations on "smoothies". It was my first time trying out Supabase and it was amazing. Days better than Firebase. Both of these are backends as a service - the whole backend is outsourced.

## Technologies Used
- React JS
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase

## Getting Started

First fork and clone the repo. Then, run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project with the following variables(these are from your Supabase project):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL 
VITE_SUPABASE_PW 
```

Once that is done, run ```npm start``` to view it on localhost.
