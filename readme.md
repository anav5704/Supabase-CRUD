![hero](https://github.com/Supabase-CRUD/blob/main/supa-smoothies.png)

Ths is a very simple website where you can perform CRUD operations on "smoothies". It was my first time tyying out Supabase and it was amazing. Days better than Firebase. Both of these are backends as a service - the whole backend is outsourced.

## Technologeis Used
- React JS
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase

## Geting Started

First fork and clone the repo. First run ```npm install``` to download all the dependencies. Now, set up your environmental variables. Make a ```.env``` file in the root of your project with the following variables(these are from your Supabase project):

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL 
VITE_SUPABASE_PW 
```

Once that is done, run ```npm start``` to view it on localhost.
